# Backend Project

This is the backend for the Coderr web application. It includes user authentication, a REST API, and database integration.

Please clone **my version** of the frontend instead of using the original one.

I've made a few minor changes:
- Removed some unintentional trailing HTML tags
- Error warning "dies ist nur als Kunde mÃ¶glich" changed to "Dies ist nur als Kunde mÃ¶glich."
- CSS-Rule for p-Elements added for privacy policy (padding-inline: 1em;)

(You're welcome ðŸ˜‰)
This ensures that backend integration and layout behave as expected.

Important: Demo Accounts Setup

To use the Demo Login buttons (Guest Customer and Guest Business) in the frontend,
you need to manually create the following user accounts in your database:

Customer Demo Account
Username: andrey
Password: asdasd

Business Demo Account
Username: kevin
Password: asdasd24

These users can be created either via the Django admin or the registration form â€” 
whichever method you prefer. Just ensure they have the correct user_type set 
(customer or business) and matching credentials.
